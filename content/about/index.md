# AI is the future

ElementaryAI was conjured out of thin air on a Sunday morning, with a grand vision of simplifying the process of **Learning AI**.

Eventually, ElementaryAI will teach varied subjects like Mathematics, Algorithms, Logic, Machine Learning, NLP, and Robotics. But this is an arduous task. To make progress, we will start with something simple, like Programming.

You will NOT be learning how to code here, though.

We will be dealing primarily with Python, so you are expected to have a reasonable working knowledge of the language. You will mainly focus on Software Design and Architecture, learning to build practical applications which can accommodate complexity and scale well.
